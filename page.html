  <p>
    Congratulations! You are the new Site-28 Containment Director.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for the recovery and initial containment of newly-discovered anomalies
    within the New York area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Automated surveillance systems will provide you with news stories, police reports, or other
    events flagged for possible anomalous influence, and you will need to triage and investigate
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will need to balance the needs of efficient containment, preservation of the veil,
    consumption of resources, and avoiding casualties.
  </p>

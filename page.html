  <p>
    Congratulations! You are the new Site-28 Containment Director.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for the recovery and initial containment of newly-discovered anomalies
    within the New York area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Automated surveillance systems will provide you with news stories, police reports, or other
    events flagged for possible anomalous influence, and you will need to triage and investigate
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must balance the needs of efficient containment, preservation of the veil,
    and consumption of resources, all while minimizing casualties.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've received a few potential anomaly reports (PARs).
    These may be anomalous objects, people, or events, but occasionally are false positives.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will investigate one at a time, and must either dismiss the report or request an SCP
    designation in order to mark it as complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your supervisor, Site Director Sandoval, will receive automated reports on your progress in this role.

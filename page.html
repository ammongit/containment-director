    Congratulations! You are the new Site-28 Containment Director.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for the recovery and initial containment of newly-discovered anomalies within the New York area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Automated surveillance systems will provide you with news stories, police reports, or other events flagged for possible anomalous influence, and you will need to triage and investigate them.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to maintaining the veil, you must ensure anomalies are efficiently contained. The site's resources, while vast, are not infinite.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of your job, you will receive potential anomaly reports (PARs). These may be anomalous objects, people, events, or false positives.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will investigate one at a time, marking it as complete by either dismissing the report or requesting an SCP designation.
  </p>

<div id="fired" style="display: none">
  <p>
    You were too careless with how you requested resources, or annoyed the wrong people one too many times and were fired.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't worry about how much the amnestics hurt, you won't remember any of it.

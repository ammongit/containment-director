    Congratulations! You are the new Site-28 Containment Director.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for the recovery and initial containment of newly-discovered anomalies
    within the New York area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Automated surveillance systems will provide you with news stories, police reports, or other
    events flagged for possible anomalous influence, and you will need to triage and investigate
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must ensure the veil is preserved, anomalies are efficiently contained, and minimize losses.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of your job, you will receive potential anomaly reports (PARs).
    These may be anomalous objects, people, events, or false positives.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will investigate one at a time, marking it as complete by either dismissing the report
    or requesting an SCP designation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Site Director Sandoval will receive automated reports on your progress.
